\title{Initialize Expected Generalized Structural Hamming (GSH) Loss}
\usage{
initialize_expected_gsh_loss(samples, a = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{One of two possible values:
First option: An object of class \sQuote{array} containing posterior samples
from a Bayesian network distribution. Each array element encodes one
network as a binary adjacency matrix, where the rows and columns represent
nodes. A value of 1 in cell \code{(i, j)} of an adjacency matrix indicates
a directed edge from node \code{i} to node \code{j}. The third dimension
of the array corresponds to different adjacency matrices (samples) from the
posterior distribution.  Second option: An symmetric matrix whose \code{(i, j)}
element gives the relative frequency in which there is an edge from node
\code{i} to node \code{j}.}

\item{a}{A numeric scalar for the cost parameter of generalized Hamming
distance used in the GSH loss.  The other cost parameter, \eqn{b}, is equal to
\eqn{2 - a}.}
}
\value{
A pointer to an initialized GSH structure containing the posterior
probabilities of edges between each pair of nodes, which can be found using
the 'initialized_expected_gsh_loss' function.
}
\description{
This function initializes the expected GSH loss (Dahl, Bailey, Harris, Andros, 2025)
based on the given samples and value of the parameter a.
