\usage{
bantha(samples, a = 1, n_candidates = 0, candidates = NULL, n_cores = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{One of three possible values:
First option: An object of class \sQuote{array} containing posterior samples
from a Bayesian network distribution. Each array element encodes one
network as a binary adjacency matrix, where the rows and columns represent
nodes. A value of 1 in cell \code{(i, j)} of an adjacency matrix indicates
a directed edge from node \code{i} to node \code{j}. The third dimension
of the array corresponds to different adjacency matrices (samples) from the
posterior distribution.  Second option: An object returned by the function
\code{\link{gsh_loss_builder_new}} and used in calls to the function
\code{\link{gsh_loss_builder_process}}.  Third option: An object returned by
the function \code{\link{compute_expected_gsh_loss}}.}

\item{a}{A numeric scalar for the cost parameter of generalized Hamming
distance used in GSH loss.  The other cost parameter, \eqn{b}, is equal to
\eqn{2 - a}.  Do not set unless \code{samples} above is the type from the first option.}

\item{n_candidates}{The number of possible starting states to use in calculating
the best matrix estimate. Using all samples as starting states is indicated
by a value of zero.  Do not set unless \code{samples} above is the type from the first option.}

\item{candidates}{A three dimensional array (like that described for \code{samples})
the best matrix estimate. Using all samples as starting states is indicated
by a value of zero.  Do not set unless \code{samples} above is the type from the third option.}

\item{n_cores}{The number of CPU cores to use, i.e., the number of
simultaneous calculations at any given time. A value of zero indicates to
use all cores on the system.}
}
\value{
A Bayes estimate in the form of an adjacency matrix found by minimizing
the Monte Carlo approximation of the expected GSH loss using the available
samples.
}
\description{
This function provides a Bayesian network to summarize a network distribution
using the BANTHA method (Bailey, Dahl, Andros 2025).
